h1. Flash Messages Helper

Ruby on Rails view helper for displaying html flash messages in your Rails applications.

h2. Installation as a Ruby on Rails Plugin

The traditional way.
<pre>./script/plugin install git://github.com/mdeering/flash_messages_helper.git</pre>

or the old-school but still c00l way!
<pre>piston import git://github.com/mdeering/flash_messages_helper.git vendor/plugins/flash_messages_helper</pre>

or for all you hip gitsters.
<pre>git submodule add git://github.com/mdeering/flash_messages_helper.git vendor/plugins/flash_messages_helper git submodule init</pre>

h2. Usage

Once you have installed it as a plugin for your rails app usage is simple. Just call the flash_messages function within you Rails layout or view file

<pre>flash_messages</pre>

h2. Configuration Points

h3. Changing the default id of the flash elements

By default the id of the flash message element will come through as flash-_error-type_

* flash-error
* flash-notice
* flash-warning
* _ect..._

To change this you can pass set a lambda that will get called with the key of the message type.

<pre># config/initializers/flash_messages_helper_settings.rb
ActionView::Base.flash_message_id_proc = lambda {|key| "#{key}-message"}</pre>

A _error_ message will now displayed with the dom element id of _error-message_ rather then _flash-error_ throughout the application

<pre><div class="error" id="error-message">There was an error!</div></pre>

h3. Changing the default class of the flash elements

By default the class of the flash message element will come through as _error-type_

* error
* notice
* warning
* _ect..._

To change this you can pass set a lambda that will get called with the key of the message type.

<pre># config/initializers/flash_messages_helper_settings.rb
ActionView::Base.flash_message_class_proc = lambda {|key| "#{key} hideable"}</pre>

A _error_ message will now displayed with the dom element class of _error hideable rather then _error_ throughout the application

<pre><div class="error hideable" id="flash-error">There was an error!</div></pre>

h3. Changing the default html tag type of the flash elements

As a default the html tag used to wrap the flash messages is a div element.  This can be easily globally changed with the following setting.

<pre># config/initializers/flash_messages_helper_settings.rb
ActionView::Base.flash_message_tag = :p</pre>

With the above setting flash messages will be wrapped inside of a paragraph tag rather then a div.

<pre><p class="error" id="flash-error">There was an error!</p></pre>
